Note the vec.begin() and vec.end() calls in the above code block. 
Both of these return an iterator to different positions in the vector container. 
Both also return an iterator of type vector<int>::iterator.

vec.begin() returns an iterator to beginning of vec. 
However, vec.end() returns an iterator to the element one past the last element.
